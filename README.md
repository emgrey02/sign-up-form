After given this image, the project is to recreate the webpage using html and css.
- this lets me practice creating semantic and accessible html forms
- email, password, and confirm password are required fields
- includes focus state and invalid state for input elements
- javascript is used to check that the passwords match and signal an invalid state if they don't
